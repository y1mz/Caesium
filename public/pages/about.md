## The Batuhan's Network SMP
- A cracked SMP server with some tweaks over Vanilla Minecraft.
- Near zero rule experience!
- *And much more!* 

### What's this server?
The Batuhan's Network SMP (shortly tbnmc) is a simple SMP (Survival Multi Player) server that aims to give you a great experience of playing on a survival world with other people. 

In our world generation we used [Terralith](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terralith) and [Structory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/structory) mods to add more places and landscapes to explore with your friends!

### Rules
To keep our server a nice and secure place we have some tiny rules that easy to follow. 

- No Griefing or stealing from other people!
- You can't move into other peoples base without permission.
- No chat spamming! 

### Contact
If something goes wrong and you need help, we're always open to help you out. You can reach us from either our Discord Server or send our admin an e-mail.
